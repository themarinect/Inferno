Lust
“A beautiful gorgeous woman with a radiating glow.
Her charm is unlike anything you’ve seen and can easily sway people with her looks’
Although, do not let looks deceive you. Underneath all that beauty lies a genuinely evil soul.”
Lust is in a room with pillars to defeat lust. The player must choose the right pillar and attack lust.
If the player chooses the wrong pillar Lust damages and heals the amount of damage Lust deals.
The Lens of Truth is a particularly useful item here.

Gluttony
“A large foul beast with a striking stench.
Having been asleep for so long, he isn’t too happy being woken up from his slumber.
He looks to eat anything and anybody without hesitation.”
The Gluttony fight is on an open field surrounded by lava.
The player can regularly attack; however, due to Gluttony’s enormous HP and Attack, it’s quite risky.
To finish the fight effectively, the player must EQUIP FOOD and THROW or DROP onto a tile that isn’t where Gluttony.
When the player places FOOD is on a tile Gluttony rushes on that tile and eats the food while in this state Gluttony is sated,
and the player deals 4x typical damage. Endless Feast is particularly useful here.

Greed
“A rather large, muscular, and cocky man.
He desires everything the world has to offer, including money, power, and woman.
He sees you as a rather worthy foe and is eager to fight you.” Greed doesn’t deal damage instead.
Greed inflicts a the Midas infection if the player stays on a tile after 3 turns the player turns to gold resulting in a GAME OVER.
The player must be prompted after the second turn to MOVE.

Envy
“A rather pretentious and cruel person.
He is secretly jealous of your strength and kills without hesitation.”
The room starts as a standard room; however, the room size increases based on monsters slain.
Envy copies your stats and inventory and creates weak clones that flood the room.
If the player has defeated the Envy puzzle Envy cannot create clones but clones the Players current state and inventory.
